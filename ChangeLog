      Handler.  (Closes: #492498, LP: #248346)

    * Use filter instead of findstring to parse DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    * Update standards version to 3.8.0.

    Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Dec 2007 16:45:57 -0800
    * Fix segfault when displaying HTML reports introduced by the patch to
      make the browser configurable.  Thanks to Chad Skeeters for the
      patch.
    * Change menu section to Applications/Project Management per the new
      menu policy.
    * Add a Homepage control field.
    * Update standards version to 3.7.3.
    * Wrap Build-Depends for readability.

    Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 20 May 2006 22:31:51 -0700
    * Choosing revert after an idle was subtracting time from all instances
      of that task, not just the running one.  Fixed.  Thanks to Ricardo
      Lopes Pereira for the report.  (Closes: #366762)
    * Always pass the host and build types to configure.

    Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Feb 2006 00:37:01 -0800
    * Fix a segfault on daily reports when tasks have annotations and
      annotation data is requested.  (Closes: #350711)
    * Add a Last Year report.  Thanks, Bruno Gravato.  (Closes: #353046)
    * Don't compress the contrib scripts.
    * Add the build-indep and binary-indep targets.
    * Clean up stamp file handling in debian/rules.

    Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Dec 2005 11:12:33 -0800
    * Providing binary-indep in debian/rules is required by Policy even if
      there are no arch-independent packages.  Whoops.
    * Mark install target as phony in debian/rules.

    Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Mon,  3 Oct 2005 15:52:11 -0700
    * Add README.Debian explaining how to get started and describing the
      user-visible changes relative to stock GTimer.
    * Add an explicit packaging copyright and license statement.
    * Update the FSF address in copyright.

    Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Fri, 15 Jul 2005 23:41:44 -0700
    * Build-depend on libxss-dev instead of xlibs-static-dev for the X
      transition.
    * Add a -weekstart command-line option to set the first day of the week
      for weekly reports.  (Closes: #307634)
    * Use the user's locale for weekday names as well.
    * Default to sensible-browser rather than x-www-browser and separate
      that patch out from the patch to make the browser configurable.
    * Fix the erroneous change to open modes in 10_57969-printpipe.patch so
      that 22_276011-reportmode.patch is no longer necessary.
    * 21_193517-oneMinIncr.diff subsumes 10_40450-32bitism.patch, so drop
      the latter.
    * Add history log entries at the top of the affected files in each patch
      rather than adding comments at the location of the change, with the
      exception of the Debian-specific change to turn off checks for newer
      versions.
    * Build with debugging symbols by default and support noopt.
    * Remove some bits from debian/rules that weren't being used.

    Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Wed, 29 Jun 2005 18:21:16 -0700
    * Only change the configured window size on exit if the call to get the
      window size succeeds, rather than changing it to some random value off
      the stack.  Partially fixes #309779.

    Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Fri, 20 May 2005 10:05:56 -0700
    * Revert and Resume now only revert times on the timers that were
      running, rather than all timers that had time for that day.  Fixes a
      bug introduced in the last release.  Thanks to Jamm!n Wheeler for the
      report.  (Closes: #309937)

    Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Mon, 18 Apr 2005 02:00:11 -0700
    * Specify a file mode when saving reports.  (Closes: #276011)
    * Add a dialog box to configure the browser, which allows us to stop
      suggesting Netscape.  Default to x-www-browser in the absence of any
      configuration.  (Closes: #38052, #138840)
    * Revert and Resume after an idle now really back up to before the idle,
      not just when the dialog box is displayed.  Revert now makes sure
      GTimer knows it has stopped.  (Closes: #282052, #64175)
    * Avoid memory clobber when saving projects that caused long-term
      instability.  Thanks, Ove Kaaven.  (Closes: #201091)
    * Don't depend on libc6-dev.
    * Depend on xlibs-static-dev instead of xlibs-dev as libXss.a is the
      only bit of X we call directly.  libgtk will pull in the rest.
    * Quote strings properly in the menu entry.
    * Improve the long description of the package.
    * Update debhelper compatibility to V4.
    * Add a watch file.
    * General reformatting and cleanup of the Debian control files.

    Martin Hicks <mort@bork.org>  Fri,  2 Jan 2004 17:27:00 -0500
    * Add a callback to allow clearing of the paste buffer.
      Partial Close: Bug#193517
    * More increment and decrement shortcut keys and one
      minute increment and decrement.  Finishes up: Bug#193517
    * Dates in the report should now follow the user's Locale.
      Closes: Bug#204322
    * Moving files seems to break dbs so i removed the patch
      called 10_87440-rename_cz_to_cs.patch and replaced it with
      a small patch to debian/rules sent by Chad Walstrom.
    * Updated to required debhelper >= 3.0.0

    Chad Walstrom <chewie@debian.org>  Fri,  9 May 2003 19:19:32 -0500
    * Switch to DBS build process, separated individual fixes in the "patches"
      directory.  Should be easier to send patches upstream.
    * Moved po/cz.po to po/cs.po.  Closes: Bug#87740
    * Shortcutted the version_timeout_handler() function to bypass version
      checking. Closes: Bug#109329

    Chad C. Walstrom <chewie@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Feb 2001 01:07:18 -0600
    * Changed 'Recommends:' field in the control file to 'Suggests:' so
      we can keep the package in main.
    * Added 'Build-Depends' field in debian/control

    Chad C. Walstrom <chewie@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Feb 2001 00:57:20 -0600
    * Added netscape to the 'Recommends:' field of the control file.
      This software has hard-coded the use of netscape as the viewer of
      the HTML report, unfortunately.

    Chad C. Walstrom <chewie@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Feb 2001 00:14:49 -0600
    * Reapplied fix for 32-bit-isms noted earlier by David.  Closes: Bug#40450

    Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Feb 2000 15:22:43 +0100
    * Fix unsafe /tmp usage with patch from BTS. Closes: Bug#57969

    David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Jun 1999 14:15:10 -0400

      Alpha at least).
    * Fixed some (probably harmless) 32-bit-isms.

        User can decrement time from selected task for current day.
      Paste will apply stored in the cut/paste buffer to the currently
